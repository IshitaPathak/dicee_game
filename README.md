## How it Works??
It is a game which requires two player. There are two dice present on the web page and when you hit refresh the website, then both the dice thrown randomly so that both the player have their own new dice values and then webpage will announce a winner whose dice value are more and if both the player have same dice value than game is draw. And you can again start the game by refresh the webpage.
